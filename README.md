Password Generation: How to Use

1) Download related files (createpassword, password.cpp)
2) Open Terminal to the folder where the downloaded files are.
3) chmod +x createpassword
4) cp createpassword /usr/local/bin

To run it, type createpassword followed by 1) the number of passwords you want, and 2) the length of the passwords
ex: createpassword 10 10 produces:
374ACPeHbm
bCD13'rbVX
Hd241pHNGY
Vi65ibkucO
ypP25aMcbM

Note: this will only work in the directory where createpassword and password.cpp are. You should ideally move them into a place where you'll use them most often (aka your home directory, if you want to be able to type in the command as soon as you open your Terminal window).

COMING SOON: will be able to generate a list of passwords whose lengths fall within a specifies range!
